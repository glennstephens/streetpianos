# Street Pianos

This project is a mini-passion project that I've wanted to build for a while. It lists all the street pianos that are available in a given area. I love discovering them when I travel and love movements like the "Play me I'm yours" and discovering them is a lot of fun. My favorite recent ones include the one at the Brisbane Children's hospital and the grand piano at Terminal 4 at LAX. 

So this will be a Xamarin.Forms based app to display all the street pianos with code written using MVVM to also allow for a Blazor support. The aim is to run this service for very little cost, so initially I'd like to do the following:

* Data coming from a Azure SQL Server database
* Retrieve data using Azure functions
* Store images of the pianos in Azure Blob Storage
* Have the Web App run on Azure Blob Storage using a CDN

I'm expecting the first run of the app to take a little time, not be too pretty and we'll polish it, load some extra data into it and then get it on the App Stores.
